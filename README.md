Looking at China's growth rate over time, we can clearly see that they were able to curb the growth rate of the virus. Over the last few weeks, 
different countries have performed different forms of mitigation to do the same: ban large gatherings, close schools, stop incoming flights, put cities in lockdown, etc.
The task is to evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation by trying to see if a correlation can be discovered between the different types of mitigation 
and the growth rate of confirmed cases. What measures seem to work and which not? Which ones are the most effective? 
Keep in mind there are numerous factors that might affect the growth rate (e.g. country's general hygiene, population density, how much time they had to prepare) 
so not all countries can be compared easily. China being an obvious outlier since it was country 0.
